# Square-Root-of-a-Number

Question Explanation:

Input: 64 8

Output: Square root of A is equal to B

The program aims to compare the square root of a number A with another number B to determine if they are equal. The process involves calculating the square root of A and checking if it matches B.

Logical Approach:

Read Inputs:
Read two numbers A and B.

Calculate the Square Root of A:
Use A ** 0.5 to calculate the square root of A. This is based on the mathematical principle that the square root of a number N can be computed as N to the power of 0.5.

Check if the Square Root of A is Equal to B:
Compare the square root of A with B and store the result (True/False) in is_equal.

Output:
If is_equal is True, print Square root of A is equal to B.
Otherwise, print Square root of A is not equal to B.

Example for Clarity:

If the inputs are A = 64 and B = 8:
The square root of 64 is 8, and 8 is equal to B (8).
Therefore, the output will be Square root of A is equal to B.

The output for these inputs will be: Square root of A is equal to B
